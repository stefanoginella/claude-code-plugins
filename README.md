# 🧩 Claude Code Plugins

My collection of opinionated Claude Code plugins — built by a solo dev for solo devs.

I'm a freelance developer exploring what AI-assisted development can actually look like when you give it real structure. These plugins are my experiments in that space, and I hope they can be useful to other developers too. If you have ideas for improvements or new plugins, please open an issue or submit a PR!

## 💡 Why

- **Opinionated by design.** These plugins make choices for you — that's the point. Less decision fatigue, more shipping.
- **Automation over discipline.** If a step can be encoded, it shouldn't depend on you remembering it. The plugin remembers so you don't have to.
- **Solo doesn't mean sloppy.** One person can ship with the rigor of a team when the tooling does the heavy lifting.

## 📦 Installation

Add the marketplace from the **Marketplace** tab of `/plugin` or directly:

```
/plugin marketplace add stefanoginella/claude-code-plugins

Then install individual plugins from the **Discover** tab of `/plugin` or directly:
