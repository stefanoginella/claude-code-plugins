# 🧩 Claude Code Plugins

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE) [![Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Code-Plugin_Marketplace-blueviolet)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

My collection of opinionated Claude Code plugins — built by a solo dev for solo devs.

I'm a freelance developer exploring what AI-assisted development can actually look like when you give it real structure. These plugins are my experiments in that space, and I hope they can be useful to other developers too. If you have ideas for improvements or new plugins, please open an issue or submit a PR!

## 💡 Why

- **Opinionated by design.** These plugins make choices for you — that's the point. Less decision fatigue, more shipping.
- **Automation over discipline.** If a step can be encoded, it shouldn't depend on you remembering it. The plugin remembers so you don't have to.
- **Solo doesn't mean sloppy.** One person can ship with the rigor of a team when the tooling does the heavy lifting.

## 🔌 Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
